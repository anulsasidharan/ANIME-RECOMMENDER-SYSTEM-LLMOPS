# 🎌 ANIME RECOMMENDER SYSTEM with LLM + MLOps

> A scalable, modular anime recommendation system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and MLOps — combining semantic embeddings, vector search, pipelines, and cloud-native deployment.

---

## 🎯 Overview

**ANIME-RECOMMENDER-SYSTEM-LLMOPS** is a recommendation engine that uses **LLMs for text embeddings** and a **vector database** to deliver highly relevant anime suggestions.  

It is designed with **MLOps best practices** in mind: modular pipelines, containerized deployments, observability, and cloud scalability.

**Example Use Case:**
> “Recommend anime similar to *Death Note* but with more fantasy elements.”

## 🏁 Conclusion

The ANIME-RECOMMENDER-SYSTEM-LLMOPS demonstrates how LLMs, vector search, and MLOps practices can be combined to build a scalable and production-ready recommendation engine.

While this project focuses on anime recommendations, the architecture is generalizable to any domain where semantic understanding and personalization are crucial — from e-commerce to content discovery and learning platforms.

This system highlights the value of:

🔹 LLMs for semantic embeddings

🔹 Vector databases for similarity search

🔹 MLOps for scalability, reproducibility, and reliability

🚀 The journey doesn’t end here — future work can explore personalization, multimodal embeddings, hybrid recommenders, and feedback loops to make the system even more powerful and user-centric.
